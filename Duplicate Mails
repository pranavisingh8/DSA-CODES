✅ Problem Summary:
You're given a list of email IDs (represented as integers).

If any ID occurs more than once, only one should be kept — the rest should be deleted.

You need to count the number of deletions required.

✅ Your Code:
python:

def countDuplicate(numbers):
    c = 0
    for i in set(numbers):  # Go through each unique number
        if numbers.count(i) > 1:  # If a number occurs more than once
            c += numbers.count(i) - 1  # Add (count - 1) to deletions
    return c

n = int(input())
numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(countDuplicate(numbers))
